  ## Project description

  Proton-proton collisions within the ATLAS experiment at The Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
  produce multiple jets. Some of the jets appear more frequent, it is important to separate the
  jets, as the ongoing research for finding new particles often look for specific jets. In addition,
  current and future collision conditions at the LHC produce a large number of less interesting
  jets, which need to be separated from the other jets.

  In this case study we will focus on classifying W-bosons, quarks, and gluons. And if time,
  broaden the scope to other particles. The dataset provided contains pictures of 2D
  representations of energy deposition from particles interacting with a colorimeter. The aim is to
  explore different models, architecture, and deep learning techniques to optimism the result.
  Convolutional neural network has been successfully applied to this task within the ATLAS
  collaboration and can be a natural starting point.

  ### Goals:

  - Classifying the different jets
  - Experiment with different models and architectures.
  - If there is time, expand to other particles.
